This project represents my first significant experience in Data Analysis, and I'm very proud of it, as writing the entire code was quite challenging. Together, as a team of four determined specialists (whom I now proudly call specialists, although we started as freshmen), we tackled all the issues and successfully completed our Final Project at the Data Lab Academy in Coders Lab.

Project Overview:

During this project, we were responsible for improving the data flow and analytics process for a company that previously relied on manual processes due to the limitations of external tools. By integrating an external API service, we were able to automate these tasks, significantly enhancing efficiency.

Our Approach:

We tackled the project by adopting roles corresponding to various professions within the IT industry:

Data Engineer:
Downloading data from an external API service.
Preparing and uploading data to the database.
Data Analyst:
Analyzing the retrieved data.
BI Developer:
Creating reports and visualizing the data.
The dataset focused on the airline industry, covering flights, airports, weather, and various factors influencing outcomes. Our task was to automate the process of addressing the issues identified at the beginning of the project by leveraging the insights derived from this data.

Outcome:
The project successfully automated a previously manual process, leading to a more streamlined and efficient data management and analysis workflow. This allowed for quicker decision-making and improved operational efficiency in the airline industry context.d
