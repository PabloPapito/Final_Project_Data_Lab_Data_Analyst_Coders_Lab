This is my very first real project in Data Analysis, I'm ver proud of it because it was not quite easy to write whole this code. We, yes, We as a team of 4 great specialists (I can say that now, because at the begining we were freshman :]), solve all those issues and get to the final of Final Project in our Data Lab Academy at Coders Lab. 

Mayby few words about the project.

During the task, we played the role of the person responsible for improving the data flow and analytics process. Previously, due to the use of an external tool, the company was forced to perform all these activities manually. Thanks to the provision of an external service, it was possible to automate the task.

During the work, we took the following steps, which we will group according to the corresponding professions in the IT industry.

  Data Engineer
    downloading data from an external API service
    preparing and uploading data to the database
